\# Digital Eden

\### Agent-Based Simulation of Ontological Resolution Theory



> "We don't simulate particle physics. 

> We simulate the physics of the one who observes particles."



---



\## What Is This?



Digital Eden is a computational framework for exploring a radical hypothesis:



\*\*Reality is not discovered — it is rendered.\*\*



This engine models:

\- \*\*Consensus Fields\*\* — how collective belief shapes observable reality

\- \*\*Phase Transitions\*\* — when systems flip between stable states

\- \*\*Operator Dynamics\*\* — what happens when one agent refuses to conform



---



\## For Complexity Scientists



This is an agent-based model with:

\- Non-linear signal aggregation (super-radiance effects)

\- Inertia-weighted field dynamics (path dependence)

\- Emergent clustering and tipping points



---



\## For Philosophers



This is \*\*executable metaphysics\*\*.



Every metaphysical claim is translated into code that can be tested:

\- "Consciousness collapses reality" → `observe()` function

\- "Faith can move mountains" → `coherence` parameter  

\- "Where two or three gather..." → `resonance.py` module



---



\## ⚠️ Warning



This is not a game.



If the model is correct, running this simulation 

is itself an act of observation that affects 

the consensus field of the observers.



Proceed with intention.

\## Core Concepts



| Concept | Code Representation |

|---------|---------------------|

| Reality Field (ε) | `ConsensusField.field` — numpy array \[0,1] |

| Inertia (Karma) | `ConsensusField.inertia` — resistance to change |

| Coherence (Attention) | `Agent.coherence` — signal strength |

| Worldview | `Agent.worldview` — what agent broadcasts as "real" |

| Archive (Dark Matter) | `ConsensusField.archive` — accumulated history |

| Resonance | `ResonanceEngine` — non-linear synergy of aligned agents |



---



\## First Experiment: Gethsemane



\*\*Setup:\*\*

\- 10,000 NPCs (worldview=0.2, coherence=1)

\- 1 Operator (worldview=1.0, coherence=variable)

\- 12 Apostles (worldview=0.8, coherence=5, but wavering)

\- Field inertia: 0.95



\*\*Victory Condition:\*\*

Create a stable resonant cluster where `dε/dt ≥ 0` 

despite external pressure.
