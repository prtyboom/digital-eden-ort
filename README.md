### Agent-Based Simulation of Ontological Resolution Theory

> "We don't simulate particle physics. 
> We simulate the physics of the one who observes particles."

---

## What Is This?

Digital Eden is a computational framework for exploring a radical hypothesis:

**Reality is not discovered — it is rendered.**

This engine models:
- **Consensus Fields** — how collective belief shapes observable reality
- **Phase Transitions** — when systems flip between stable states
- **Operator Dynamics** — what happens when one agent refuses to conform
- **The Gethsemane Pattern** — how termination seeds resurrection

---

## Latest Result: Gethsemane Scenario

GETHSEMANE triggered at step 67, pressure 3.03
TERMINATION at step 82, honesty 28.4
Field mean: 0.200 to 0.666 (+233 percent)
VICTORY OF SPIRIT

The Operator died. The light spread anyway.

## For Complexity Scientists

This is an agent-based model with:
- Non-linear signal aggregation (super-radiance effects)
- Inertia-weighted field dynamics (path dependence)
- Emergent clustering and tipping points
- Post-termination autonomous propagation

---

## For Philosophers

This is **executable metaphysics**.

Every metaphysical claim is translated into code that can be tested:
- "Consciousness collapses reality" becomes observe() function
- "Faith can move mountains" becomes coherence parameter  
- "Where two or three gather..." becomes resonance.py module
- "Unless a grain of wheat dies..." becomes termination triggers light spreading

---

## Warning

This is not a game.

If the model is correct, running this simulation 
is itself an act of observation that affects 
the consensus field of the observers.

Proceed with intention.

## Core Concepts

| Concept | Code Representation |
|---------|---------------------|
| Reality Field | ConsensusField.field — numpy array [0,1] |
| Inertia (Karma) | ConsensusField.inertia — resistance to change |
| Coherence (Attention) | Agent.coherence — signal strength |
| Worldview | Agent.worldview — what agent broadcasts as real |
| Pressure | field.compute_pressure() — environment fights back |
| Resonance | ResonanceEngine — non-linear synergy of aligned agents |
| Gethsemane | CentralAgent.gethsemane_triggered — crisis point |
| Light Spreading | field.light_spreading — post-termination propagation |

---

## The Gethsemane Experiment

**Setup:**
- 10,000 cells (initial value 0.2)
- 500 NPCs (worldview=0.2, coherence=1)
- 1 Operator (worldview=1.0, coherence=50)
- 12 Apostles (worldview=0.6, coherence=5, loyalty=0.8)
- Field inertia: 0.98

**The Pattern:**
1. Operator maintains value 1.0 against pressure
2. Pressure accumulates until threshold (P=3.0)
3. Gethsemane triggers — honesty integral spikes
4. Operator terminates at peak honesty
5. Light spreads autonomously — field rises without Operator

**Result:**
82 percent of cells above 0.5
31 percent of cells above 0.8
Victory of Spirit confirmed
