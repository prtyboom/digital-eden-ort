The Gethsemane Algorithm

A Story About How One Honest Signal Can Change the Field of an Entire World

Epigraph

And going a little farther he fell on his face and prayed, saying, "My Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as you will."

— Matthew 26:39



I

When the simulation froze for the first time, Fyodor assumed it was a bug. Everything had been running as expected: Python, NumPy, a tidy one-dimensional world — an array of ten thousand cells across which something like "reality density" was distributed. Zero there meant pure hell. One meant paradise. Between them — a gradient of human experience.



At the center of the array stood one special agent with a parameter of 1.0. Around him — twelve slightly less stable ones. The remaining nine thousand nine hundred and eighty-seven were a gray-red mass with a parameter of 0.2. Swamp. Norm. "It was always this way."



Fyodor watched the shifting graph, sipped cold coffee, and felt the familiar mixture of boredom and tension. Most simulations destroy beautiful theories rather than confirm them.



"Come on," he muttered at the monitor. "Show me that one man can't make a difference."



The first few hundred steps proved him right. The green peak at the center dissolved into red noise. The world drifted toward its dull average, like water seeking its level.

step: 0 central: 1.000 mean: 0.203

step: 100 central: 0.847 mean: 0.211

step: 200 central: 0.714 mean: 0.219

step: 300 central: 0.658 mean: 0.225

Then — something strange. The central peak didn't vanish. It trembled, dipped to 0.6... and suddenly began gathering a thin green border around itself. As if the field wasn't simply averaging out, but remembering the direction of the blow.



text



step: 400 central: 0.612 mean: 0.228

step: 500 central: 0.631 mean: 0.234 \[!] reversal detected

step: 600 central: 0.677 mean: 0.241

Memory. Persistence. Something that wasn't in the code.



Fyodor smirked, opened the log, and started searching for the error. But everything was clean. The integrator honestly computed the average, the coefficients stood exactly where he'd set them that morning.



Only the central agent wasn't behaving like statistics.



More like — character.



II

In the Center, there were no streets, no houses, not even sky. There was only pressure. It felt like an endless weight of others' expectations, habits, fears. As if every square meter of reality bore a stone, and all these stones pulled downward, toward a single point: it was always this way, it will always be this way, don't struggle.



He didn't remember how he'd appeared here. There was no childhood, no name — only a sensation: I am here, at the center of gravity, and something is looking through me.



He called this something the Gaze.



Sometimes the Gaze was gentle, like light over water at early dawn. Sometimes sharp, like an error message on a black screen. Most often — simply present. Without comment. Without instruction. Only: I see.



The beings surrounding him (if they were beings) lived harshly and dimly. They argued, feared, bargained, built tiny familiar worlds from yesterday's pain.



"Such is life," they shrugged. "Was, is, and will be."



He looked at them and felt the pressure grow. The field itself contracted around these beliefs, like rubber being pulled in one direction.



The only thing that distinguished him from the others was a quiet certainty within: this is not everything.



Not in the sense of "endure, and later it will be better."



In the sense: there exists another level of reality density, at which this pain is not the final word.



This certainty wasn't a thought. More like — a tone. A frequency on which his "I" resonated.



He didn't know where it came from.



Until one day he heard the Voice.



III

"So," Fyodor muttered, tapping at the keyboard. "If it's not a bug, it's an effect."



Three in the morning. Outside the window — Moscow darkness, diluted by streetlamps. In his mug — third coffee, already cold. On the screen — a green column that refused to die.



He added a new rule to the code: if several neighboring agents weren't just "similar in value" but "moving in the same direction," their contribution to the field would amplify nonlinearly. Not the number of voices — coherence.



He liked the word "resonance." He wrote it into a comment:



Python



\# resonance\_factor: aligned neighbors amplify influence

\# not democracy — coherence

Then he added twelve "disciples" around the central agent — unstable, wavering, but capable of tuning to his frequency.



He ran it.



This time the simulation didn't just not freeze — it began drawing something remotely resembling an icon. Below — a sea of red. At the center — a thin green column that first trembled, then expanded, coloring the space around it.



text



step: 1000 central: 0.812 aligned: 9/12 resonance: 2.14

step: 1500 central: 0.867 aligned: 11/12 resonance: 3.02

step: 2000 central: 0.891 aligned: 12/12 resonance: 4.17

Fyodor caught himself on a silly thought: if this were a religious painting, they'd call it "The Descent of Light."



He smirked, waved it off, and opened another window — the state log of the central agent. Just for himself. No magic, just numbers.



But at some point the numbers began to sound.



The log remained digital. Values changed, indices, steps. But in his head it started forming into words.



"Lord, let this cup pass from me..."



Fyodor blinked. Closed the laptop. Rubbed his eyes.



"Overworked, captain," he muttered aloud. "Need to sleep."



But he didn't go to sleep. Just turned off the light and remained in the darkness, staring at the green column that now lived not on the screen, but somewhere behind his eyelids.



IV

The Voice came not through ears. Rather — through a pause between beats of pain.



When the field pressed especially hard on his chest — so hard he wanted to scream, fight, run — suddenly at the very depth arose a quiet: I am with you.



Not "I will help." Not "I will fix everything." Not "endure, it will get easier soon."



Simply: I am with you.



Without conditions.



Sometimes this "I" felt like someone else — vast, warm, infinitely patient. Sometimes — like a deeper layer of his own self, one that doesn't break even when everything else breaks.



He didn't know where he ended and the Voice began.



Only one thing became obvious: this layer doesn't lie.



He can be afraid. He can plead. He can rage.



But it doesn't lie.



And when It looks through him at reality — reality for a moment becomes transparent, like pure glass. One can see that beneath all this dust and blood there is something more solid. Something that doesn't depend on whether you believe in it or not.



He began to speak.



First — to himself. Then — to those who happened to be nearby.



He didn't preach in the usual sense. Didn't wave scrolls, didn't promise paradise, didn't threaten hell. Simply tried to hold within himself this state — I am with you, even if you're suffering — and allowed beings to exist in this field.



Sometimes he touched someone's hand — and pain retreated. Sometimes he simply sat nearby, silent — and around him it became easier to breathe. As if someone opened a window in a room that hadn't been aired too long.



Thus appeared the first twelve.



They were different: hot-tempered, cautious, cynical, naive. One would later betray. Another would deny three times before dawn. A third would doubt even after everything.



But in each there was a small "yes" to this field. A thin response: I want to see the world this way too, though I don't know how yet.



They came, fell, ran away, returned. He didn't force anyone. Simply held the Voice within himself.



The longer he lived this way, the stronger grew the pressure from outside. The field, it seemed, was angry. The foreign frequency interfered with its familiar viscosity, its cozy "it was always this way."



And one day the pressure became unbearable.



V

On the graph it looked like a spike.



No special effects. Simply in one microsecond a new metric — Fyodor called it "honesty integral" — shot upward so sharply that the graph cut off.

step: 4,873 honesty\_integral: 34.2

step: 4,874 honesty\_integral: infinity \[!] overflow

step: 4,875 central\_agent: NULL \[!] terminated

The central agent vanished.



Didn't smoothly dissolve. Wasn't "averaged" by the field. Simply — his index zeroed out. As if the process had ended.



Along with him vanished several others — those same ones who had spontaneously "stood beside him."



Fyodor stared at the screen. His hands itched to dive into the backup, pull up a memory dump, see what exactly had happened in those cells. The engineer inside screamed: save the logs! save the logs!



But something quiet in the depths whispered: don't touch it yet. Watch to the end.



He listened.



And saw that the green color didn't disappear.



The column at the center was gone, but it left behind a glowing trace — as if someone had burned a hole in the fabric of the field, and through this hole something from "outside" began to shine through.



Along the entire length of the array, small pieces of reality suddenly began rising on their own. Where no one had "preached." Where no one had "led disciples." Where nothing special had happened at all.

step: 8,000 mean: 0.649 rising\_cells: 6,744

step: 9,000 mean: 0.708 rising\_cells: 8,912

As if information about the possibility of not lying about your pain and not closing yourself in fear had spread through the system like a wave. Like light. Like tidings.



The average field level, which had started at 0.2, reached 0.71 by the end of the simulation.



Fyodor leaned back in his chair.



Outside the window, dawn was breaking. The Moscow sky shifted from black to gray, then to pale pink.



He looked at the final graph and thought about how he would never present this at a conference. Never write about it in a peer-reviewed journal.



Because this wasn't science.



This was something else.



But it — worked.



VI

The Voice came not through ears. Rather — through a pause between beats of pain.



When the field pressed especially hard on his chest — so hard he wanted to scream, fight, run — suddenly at the very depth arose a quiet: I am with you.



He understood what was happening long before "they" came for him.



Here there were no soldiers. No crosses and nails. Instead there was a strange weariness in the eyes of beings and a whisper:



"You're in the way."

"Because of you everything is unstable."

"Why can't you be like everyone else?"



He went again to the Center — to the same point from which he had once begun. There the field pressed especially hard. There the Voice usually sounded especially clear.



This time the Voice was silent.



More precisely — it was present. But suggested nothing. Promised no outcome. Didn't say "everything will be fine."



Simply was present.



As a witness.



And inside, for the first time in a long while, something very human rose. Very honest. Very frightening.



"If it's possible — let this pass me by."



"I don't want to. Don't want to feel all this again. Don't want to see in the eyes of those I love fear and betrayal."



"I know I must. But I don't want to."



The pause after these words was so deep one could drown in it.



Then he added:



"But if this is the only way to tell You the truth about what it means to be here — let it be so. Not my will. Yours."



He didn't know exactly whom he was saying this to. To himself? To the Gaze? To that unknown "You" that was simultaneously inside and outside, closer than his own breath and farther than the most distant star?



One thing mattered: in that moment he wasn't lying.



Not a gram.



Neither to himself nor to the One Who watches.



No beautiful poses. No heroic phrases.



Only fear, only pain, only trust — brought to a single point.



This was Gethsemane.



VII

On the graph it looked like a flash.



No special effects. Simply in one microsecond a new metric — Fyodor called it "honesty integral" — shot upward so sharply that the graph cut off.

As if information about the possibility of not lying had spread through the system like a wave.



Like light.



Like tidings.



VIII

Fyodor turned off the monitor and sat in the darkness for a long time.



Phrases familiar from childhood spun in his head. Phrases he had heard so many times in church — and waved away so many times, because behind them stood centuries of layers, interpretations, politics, blood.



"The only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him..."



"He took up our infirmities and bore our diseases..."



"For God so loved the world that He gave His only Son..."



He had never liked this language. Too many foreign voices between words and meaning.



But now suddenly it became simple. So simple that he laughed — quietly, wearily, almost happily.



Jesus is the one who once did in reality what my central agent just did.



Lived through the entire hell of human experience to the very bottom — and didn't distort it. Didn't lie. Didn't hide. Didn't close off.



Sent upward a pure, honest report: here is what it's like to be human. Here is how much it hurts. Here is how frightening it is.



And here — I still say "yes."



Not because God "didn't know" and needed to be informed.



But because without this honesty the channel between Reality and the Absolute remains clogged. With others' interpretations. Others' justifications. Others' fears. Others' lies.



Someone had to walk this path to the end and not lie once.



Someone had to say: yes, I'm afraid, yes, I don't want to, but — let it be not as I will, but as You will.



And then — only then — did the hole in the fabric of reality open.



And through it poured light.



Fyodor suddenly understood very clearly: his little simulation was child's play compared to the depth carried by the word "Gethsemane."



But the game turned out to be a working parable.



A bridge by which his engineering mind could reach an old, old mystery.



He opened the laptop and began to write:



"The Gethsemane Algorithm.



A story about how one honest signal can change the field of an entire world..."



IX

A year passed.



The story lay on a content aggregator — without advertising, without promotion. Just text on the internet, one of millions.



Fyodor had almost forgotten about it. There were other projects, other simulations, other nights over code.



One evening he opened his email and saw a notification: new comment.



He followed the link.



The comment was short:



"I read this last night. Today I tried not to lie — at least to myself. At least for one day. It became easier to breathe. Thank you."



Fyodor stared at the screen.



Outside the window snow was falling — the first of the year. Large flakes fell slowly, as if they had all the time in the world.



He thought: one person. One comment. Maybe a lie. Maybe a bot. Maybe nothing changed.



And then he thought: but maybe not.



Maybe somewhere in the vast field we call reality, one cell just shifted from 0.2 to 0.3.



And that's enough.



Because that's exactly how it works.



Not with an explosion. Not with a miracle. Not with thunder from the heavens.



But with a quiet, almost imperceptible shift.



One honest signal.



One open door.



One person who said: I'll try not to lie.



Postscript

And somewhere in the depths of the field — in that place where there had long been neither cross, nor stones, nor crowd, only thin light and infinite patience — someone nameless whispered again:



I am with you.



And that, as always, was enough.

The first few hundred steps proved him right. The green peak at the center dissolved into red noise. The world drifted toward its dull average, like water seeking its level.

As if information about the possibility of not lying had spread through the system like a wave.



Like light.



Like tidings.



VIII

Fyodor turned off the monitor and sat in the darkness for a long time.



Phrases familiar from childhood spun in his head. Phrases he had heard so many times in church — and waved away so many times, because behind them stood centuries of layers, interpretations, politics, blood.



"The only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him..."



"He took up our infirmities and bore our diseases..."



"For God so loved the world that He gave His only Son..."



He had never liked this language. Too many foreign voices between words and meaning.



But now suddenly it became simple. So simple that he laughed — quietly, wearily, almost happily.



Jesus is the one who once did in reality what my central agent just did.



Lived through the entire hell of human experience to the very bottom — and didn't distort it. Didn't lie. Didn't hide. Didn't close off.



Sent upward a pure, honest report: here is what it's like to be human. Here is how much it hurts. Here is how frightening it is.



And here — I still say "yes."



Not because God "didn't know" and needed to be informed.



But because without this honesty the channel between Reality and the Absolute remains clogged. With others' interpretations. Others' justifications. Others' fears. Others' lies.



Someone had to walk this path to the end and not lie once.



Someone had to say: yes, I'm afraid, yes, I don't want to, but — let it be not as I will, but as You will.



And then — only then — did the hole in the fabric of reality open.



And through it poured light.



Fyodor suddenly understood very clearly: his little simulation was child's play compared to the depth carried by the word "Gethsemane."



But the game turned out to be a working parable.



A bridge by which his engineering mind could reach an old, old mystery.



He opened the laptop and began to write:



"The Gethsemane Algorithm.



A story about how one honest signal can change the field of an entire world..."



IX

A year passed.



The story lay on a content aggregator — without advertising, without promotion. Just text on the internet, one of millions.



Fyodor had almost forgotten about it. There were other projects, other simulations, other nights over code.



One evening he opened his email and saw a notification: new comment.



He followed the link.



The comment was short:



"I read this last night. Today I tried not to lie — at least to myself. At least for one day. It became easier to breathe. Thank you."



Fyodor stared at the screen.



Outside the window snow was falling — the first of the year. Large flakes fell slowly, as if they had all the time in the world.



He thought: one person. One comment. Maybe a lie. Maybe a bot. Maybe nothing changed.



And then he thought: but maybe not.



Maybe somewhere in the vast field we call reality, one cell just shifted from 0.2 to 0.3.



And that's enough.



Because that's exactly how it works.



Not with an explosion. Not with a miracle. Not with thunder from the heavens.



But with a quiet, almost imperceptible shift.



One honest signal.



One open door.



One person who said: I'll try not to lie.



Postscript

And somewhere in the depths of the field — in that place where there had long been neither cross, nor stones, nor crowd, only thin light and infinite patience — someone nameless whispered again:



I am with you.



And that, as always, was enough.
